## üöÄ Start with Codespaces
This is the fastest way to get up and running!

1. **Create a Codespace:**

   - Click the green "Code" button at the top right of your forked repo.
   - Select "Create codespace on main".
   - Once your Codespace is fully loaded, you are ready to go.
   - Run the set up command below in your terminal it should only take a few mins.
  
     ```bash
     bash setup.sh
     ```

2. **While in Codespace:**
   
   - After you successfully ran the setup in your terminal then enter your workspace. Like seen in the picture below!

3. **While in Workspace: ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Environment Setup**

      **1. Network Settings (Frontend) üåê**
   
      This setup is required to get the webpage running and connected to the correct Algorand network.

      Path: `QuickStartTemplate/projects/QuickStartTemplate-frontend`

      Steps:
      - Locate the file `.env.template` in the path above.
      - Create a new file named `.env` in the same folder as the path above.
      - Copy all contents from `.env.template`
      - Paste into your new .env file.

      **2. NFT Minting (Pinata) üñºÔ∏è**
   
      This setup is required only if you plan to use the NFT Minting functionality.
     
      Path: `QuickStartTemplate-contracts/nft_mint_server`
   
      Steps:
      -  Locate the file `.env.template` in the path above.
      -  Copy all the contents of `.env.template`.  
      -  Create a new file named `.env` in the same folder.  
      -  Paste the copied content into your `.env`.  
      -  Follow the instructions inside `.env.template` to generate your **Pinata API Key** and **Secret Key**, and replace the placeholders in your new `.env` file.

## Final Step: Run the project!
   > üí° **Note:** You can stay in the **root directory** of the project when running the command. 
   > (This is usually the folder automatically opened when entering the Workspace, so you don‚Äôt need to move elsewhere.)
   
   Once your `.env` files are ready (Expecially the Network one), run the command below to start the project:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
  
   After running the command, open the localhost URL shown in your terminal.

   **Important: Set Visibility**
   You‚Äôll likely see a pop-up in the bottom-right corner. Click Set public to make the server accessible.
   OR **manually go to the Ports section, right-click the 3001 port, and set its visibility to Public.**

## Pro Tip!
GitHub Codespaces is included with free accounts but comes with a monthly limit of 60 hours. 

To avoid losing your progress, be sure to **commit your changes regularly** ‚Äî just like shown in the video demo below ‚Äî so your updates are saved to your forked repository.
